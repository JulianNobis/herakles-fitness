# herakles-fitness
## What the hell is herakles-fitness?
A platform that lets you track and analyze your physical training.

## What is planned?
Starting with predefined exercises as a web-application.\
As the project grows a nutrition guide in combination with infos about the correct training for different goals will be included.\
Planned to be available on mobile apps with more flexible training choices (more templates, the ability to create own templates) and **a way to continously progress in the gym by suggesting weight increases based on performance**.

## Tech stack
M ... MongoDB\
E ... ExpressJS\
R ... React\

## Why should you use herakles-fitness?
At the moment you shouldn't. It's garbage compared to the other apps on the market. There you go.\
